# MHacks Project 2017: ELLE

### About:

> ELLE is a real-time webchat application that
> allows users of different languages to 
> communicate. It may be used for educational 
> purposes or to interact with friends and family 
> who speak different languages. As of right 
> now, the service is annonymous, but we may 
> implement usernames and avatars in the future.
> Right now, ELLE is similar to Omegle in the sense that you
> in that you are connected with a stranger.

#### Fun Facts:

* ELLE's logo includes the avatars of an ELephant and a LEopard (EL LE).
* EL LE is a reflection of itself to show mirroring of communication and text.
* EL LE stands for Easily Learn Language Exchange
* Andrew thought ELLE was a nice sounding name
* ELLE sounds like the letter L(anguage)
